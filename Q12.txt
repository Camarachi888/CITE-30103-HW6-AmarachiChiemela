The developer got an unexpected result because arithmetic operator has higher precedence than the shift operator causing a and b to be added before the binary shift occurs. To correct this the developer can either:
	1.) use parentheses to force order
		res = a + (b<<1);
	2.) use arithmetic operation instead of shift operation
		res = a+b+b;
